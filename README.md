# hello-world
This is my first repository that will help me understand git.

I live in Wroclaw (Poland) and study IT at the University of Technology. The weather now is quite nice, I mean it's autumn, so the sky is kind of grey and leafs are either out of trees or they turned brown or yellow, still keeping a bit of their greenish so, depending on the spot you look at, you can feel nice or depressed, but I feel nice, because I'm starting to learn something new.
